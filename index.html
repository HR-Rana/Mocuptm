			<h5>About Terrence McMahon</h5>

				<div class="top-instruction">	
					<div class="leader-text">
						<p>Terrance grew his financial advisor company to 600 agents and brokers and grossing 8 figures and earning 7 figures per year, but it nearly killed him.  In 2016, Terrance was sitting in a hospital room dying from liver failure. Doctors said he had 90 days to live and that his chances of finding a match for a liver transplant in time were slim. So slim that it wasn’t until the end of his 90-day death sentence that a liver from a young prisoner in Alabama was deemed a match. 
						This last minute transplant saved his life and after reflecting on his experience he's made it his goal to help financial advisors enjoy their lives again... and avoid the place he ended up in.
						He understands the complexities of the industry better than anyone and he's created a system to get a consistent stream of qualified leads while navigating compliance hurdles
						His company is one of the first in the space to guarantee appointments at no risk for advisors because he is so confident that his system works... and now he wants to share that exact system in this course.

								<p>I’ve been drawn to helping others for a very long time. One of my clearest memories of kindergarten was being asked to help another little girl learn to read and feeling so good about that. Then, I volunteered in middle and high school as a peer mentor and ended up being a learning mentor in college as well (you might be sensing a theme here). When I went to graduate school the first time, I became an English teacher for middle and high schoolers. Since that time, I’ve taught middle school English in two different states, stayed home with my own children when they were young, written several books, and gone to graduate school AGAIN to become a therapist. So. Much. Helping. But, that’s what calls me.</p>

						<div class="instruction" data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-delay="800">

								<p>
								It was crazy and a little exciting to me when I realized that all of my past life experiences: helping, teaching, marrying, parenting, divorcing, and writing were joining together to support my role as a therapist and, even more than that, as a therapist that specializes in high conflict relationships. This is not what my little kindergarten self imagined when she felt that first joy of being a helper! And yet, I’m so grateful to be here.

								My work, for the last many years, has been to notice and interpret patterns and cycles in high conflict relationships. Even more than that, though, my work has been to develop and test out strategies that change those patterns and cycles and to help my clients feel like they’ve gotten their lives back. It turns out that knowing how, when, and why we should change our reactions to high conflict people can actually free us and allow us to manifest who we really want to be!

								<p>Oh, and if you’re curious, I live in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area with my husband...plus, the most loyal dog ever, two old cats, the neighbor’s chicken, our youngest’s hamster, and occasionally, our youngest. When I’m not doing what I do for others, I’m out back vegetable gardening or up near Lake Superior, hiking whenever I can.</p>
